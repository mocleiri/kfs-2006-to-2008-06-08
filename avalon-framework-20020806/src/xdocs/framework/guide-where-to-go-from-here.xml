      <p>
        Each of the pages in this short guide deserves an entire book, and
        indeed, most of them have a lot of documentation devoted to them.
        Here we provide you with pointers where else to look for more
        information, within and outside of Avalon.

    <s1 title="Creating components">
      <p>
        After all the information in this guide has sunk in, you're probably
        itching to write an Avalon Component. Our
        <link href="@AVALON_BASE@/developing">
          Developing with Avalon guide
        </link> takes you through doing just that. You can download it as a PDF
        and read at your leisure (it comes down to 56 printed pages). If that's
        too much for you, we suggest you get the latest
        <link href="@AVALON_BASE@/excalibur">excalibur</link> release and
        take those components as an example. One application that uses a lot of
        those components and is in widespread daily use is
        <link href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon">Cocoon</link>.
