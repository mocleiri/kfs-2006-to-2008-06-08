    <s1 title="Introduction">
      <p>If you are completely new to Avalon, the Framework subproject is not
      the easiest place to start. We suggest you take a look at the
      <link href="@AVALON_BASE@/phoenix/getting-started.html">Avalon Phoenix getting started document</link>
      first, as it will take you through downloading, installing and then
      running something (a very simple server program) much more concrete.</p>

      <p>Probably the next smart step is to learn by example. Take a look at
      one or two of the <link href="@AVALON_BASE@/apps">applications</link>
      that use avalon and at how well these are set up, and at some of the
      available <link href="@AVALON_BASE@/excalibur">components (in Excalibur)</link>
      and <link href="@AVALON_BASE@/cornerstone">services (in Cornerstone)</link>
      Avalon offers.</p>

      <p>You will find that the Framework has an important role in each and
      every one of these. To learn what that role is and how it fulfills this
      role, you should read our guide, which starts with a summary of
      <link href="guide-oop-best-practices.html">OOP best practices</link>.</p>

      <p>When you get stuck in sources, documentation, and the mailing list archive,
      post your questions to the mailing list (information on it is
      <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html">here</link>). For
      many, Avalon poses a steep learning curve, and we'll try and help you
      flatten it as much as we can.</p>
