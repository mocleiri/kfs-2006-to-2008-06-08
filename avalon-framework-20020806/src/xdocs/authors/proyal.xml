      Peter is a relative newcomer to Apache Avalon. His introduction was
      via the <link href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/">Apache Cocoon</link>
      project. After noticing the incredible framework which Cocoon was built
      upon he moved the rest of his projects to be hosted in Avalon Phoenix.
