      <para>
          Jeff is a 23-year old Sydney programmer who became involved with
          Avalon through a long-standing interest in the XML Cocoon project.
          After submitting a few patches, berating the lack of docs and
          examples, and gradually becoming a fan of COP, he found himself voted
          a committer and escape was impossible.
    </para>
    <para>
        Jeff has a tragic inability to overlook small deficiencies in things
        like build systems and documentation. He therefore spends much more
        time fixing these than coding, which is okay because Avalon has no
        shortage of programming talent.
