  <title>Implementing the Dream</title>
  <subtitle>
    We will show how you can use Avalon Framework and Avalon Excalibur to
    realize your services.  We will show just how easy Avalon is to use.
  </subtitle>
  <para>
    After your analysis is complete, you need to create the Components and
    Services that make up your system.  Avalon would be of little use if it
    only described some idioms for you to use.  Even then, the use of those
    idioms and patterns would still help in understanding the overall system.
    Avalon Excalibur provides some useful Components and utilities that you can
    incorporate into your own system that will make your life much easier.  For
    our demonstration, we will go through the process of defining a Component
    that retrieves a document instance from a repository.  If you recall our
    discussion about the theoretical Business Server, we identified this
    Component as a Service.  In practical situations, a Service is a Component
    that has a larger scope.
  </para>
  <section>
    <title>Implementing the Component</title>
    <para>
      At this point, we define how to implement our Component.  We will go
      through the process of implementing the DocumentRepository Component
      previously mentioned.  The first things we need to figure out are the
      concern areas for our Component.  Then we have to figure out how our
      Component will be created and managed.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>Choosing the Concern Areas</title>
      <para>
        We have already defined the Role and the Interface for our
        DocumentRepository Component in the last chapter, we are ready to
        create the implementation.  Because the interface for the
        DocumentRepository only defines one method, we have an opportunity to
        create a thread-safe Component.  This is the most desired type of
        component because it allows for the least amount of resource
        utilization.  In order for our implementation to be thread-safe, we do
        need to be careful about how we implement the Component.  Since all of
        our documents are stored in a database, and we desire to use an
        external Guardian Component, we will need access to other Components.
        As responsible developers, we will want to log messages that will help
        us debug our component, and track down what is going on internally.
        The beauty of the Avalon Framework is that you only implement the
        interfaces you need, and ignore the ones you don't.  This is where
        Separation of Concerns pays off.  As you find you need a new concern
        area addressed, you merely implement the associated interface, and
        incorporate the new functionality.  To the client of your Component,
        there is no difference.
      </para>
      <para>
        Since it is a design goal to be thread-safe, we already know that we
        need to implement the ThreadSafe interface.  The DocumentRepository
        interface only has one method, so the use of the Component's work
        interface is compatible with that requirement.  Furthermore, we know
        that a Component will not be used before it is fully initialized, nor
        will it be used once it is destroyed.
      </para>
      <para>
        There are a couple of implicit interfaces that we need to implement to
        accomplish the design.  We want our solution to be as secure as
        possible and explicitly track whether the Component is fully
        initialized or not.  To accomplish this goal, we will implement the
        Initializable and Disposable interfaces.  Since specific information
        about our environment may change, or may need to be customized, we need
        to make our DocumentRepository Configurable.  Our Component makes use
        of other Components, and the method that Avalon provides to get
        instances of the required Component is by using a ComponentManager.  We
        will need to implement the Composable interface to get an instance of
        the ComponentManager.
      </para>
      <para>
        Because the DocumentRepository accesses the documents in the database,
        we need to make a decision.  Do we want to take advantage of the Avalon
        Excalibur DataSourceComponent, or do we want to implement our own
        Connection management code.  For the sake of this paper, we will use
        the DataSourceComponent.

        At this point, our skeleton class looks like this:

        You will notice some constructs in the above code.  When you are
        designing with security in mind, you should explicitly enforce every
        contract on your Component.  Security is only as strong as the weakest
        link.  You should only use a Component when you are certain it is fully
        initialized, and never use it when it is disposed of.  I placed the
        logic that you would need in this skeleton class because that way you
        can adopt the same practices in classes that you write.

      <title>Instantiating and Managing Components</title>
      <para>
        In order for you to understand how the Container/Component relationship
        works, we will first discuss the manual method of managing Components.
        Next, we will discuss how Avalon's Excalibur Component infrastructure
        hides the complexity from you.  You will still find times when you
        would rather manage components yourself.  Most of the time the power
        and flexibility of Excalibur is just what you need.
      </para>
      <section>
        <title>The Manual Method</title>
        <para>
          All of Avalon's Components are created somewhere.  The code that
          creates the Component is that Component's Container.  The Container
          is responsible for managing the Component's lifecycle from
          construction through destruction.  A Container can be the static
          "main" method called from a command line, or it can be another
          Component.  Remember the Inversion of Control pattern when you
          design your Containers.  Information and method calls should only
          flow from the Container to the Component.
        </para>
        <warning>
          <title>Subversion of Control</title>
          <para>
            Subversion of Control is the anti-pattern to Inversion of Control.
            Subversion of control is done when you pass a reference to a
            Component's Container to the Component.  It is also done when you
            have a Component manage it's own lifecycle.  Code that operates in
            this manner should be considered defective.  The interactions that
            happen when you confuse the Container/Component relationship make
            the system harder to debug and security harder to audit.
          </para>
        </warning>
        <para>
          In order to manage the child Components, you need to keep a reference
          to them for their entire lifetime.  Before the Container or any other
          Component can use the child Component, it must go through the
          initialization phase of its lifecycle.  For our DocumentRepository,
          the code will look something like the following:

        throws Exception
    {
        Logger docLogger = new LogKitLogger( Hierarchy.defaultHierarchy()
                                             .getLoggerFor( "document" ) );

          For the sake of brevity, I removed all the explicit checking from the
          above code.  You can see that manually creating and managing
          Components is very detailed.  If you forget to do one step in the
          life of a Component, you will see bugs.  This also requires intimate
          knowledge of the Components you are instantiating.  An alternate
          approach would be to add a couple methods to the above
          <classname>ContainerComponent</classname> that handles the
          initialization of the components dynamically.

        <title>Automated Autonomy</title>
        <para>
          Developer's are naturally lazy, so they would spend the time to write
          a specialized ComponentManager that became the Container for all of
          their Components in the system.  That way they would not have to be
          bothered with intimately knowing the interfaces of all the Components
          in a system.  That can be a daunting task.  The Avalon developers
          have created just such a beast.  Avalon Excalibur's Component
          architecture includes a ComponentManager that is controlled by
          configuration files written in XML.
        </para>
        <para>
          There is a tradeoff when you relinquish the responsibility of
          managing a Component to Excalibur's ComponentManager.  You relinquish
          the fine control over what Components are included in the
          ComponentManager.  However, if you have a large system, you will find
          that manual control is a daunting task.  In that case, it is better
          for the stability of the system for one entity to centrally manage
          all the Components in a system.
        </para>
        <para>
          Since there are varying levels of integration you want to achieve
          with Excalibur's Component Architecture, we will start with the
          lowest level.  Excalibur has a group of ComponentHandler objects that
          act as individual Containers for one type of Component.  They manage
          the complete life of your Component.  Let me introduce the concept of
          lifestyle interfaces.  A lifestyle interface describes how the system
          treats a Component.  Since the lifestyle of a component has impact on
          the running of a system, we need to discuss the implications of the
          current lifestyle interfaces:

          The ComponentHandler interface is very simple to deal with.  You
          initialize the Constructor with the Java class, the Configuration
          object, the ComponentManager, a Context object, and a RoleManager.
          If you know that your Component will not need any of the
          aforementioned items, you can pass a null in its place.  After
          that, when you need a reference to the Component, you call the "get"
          method.  After you are done with it, you call the "put" method and
          pass the Component back to the ComponentHandler.  The following code
          will make it easier to understand.

          At this point, we only saved ourselves a few lines of code.  We still
          manually created our Configuration object, we still had to set the
          Logger, and we still had to initialize and dispose of the
          ComponentHandler objects.  What we did at this point is simply protect
          ourselves from changing interfaces.  You may find it better for your
          code to use this approach.  Excalibur went further though.  Most
          complex systems have configuration files, and they allow an
          administrator to alter vital Configuration information.  Excalibur
          can read a configuration file in the following format, and build the
          Components in a system from it.

          The root element can be anything you want.  You will notice that we
          now have several Components defined.  We have our familiar
          DocumentRepository class and GuardianComponent class, as well as a
          couple of Excalibur DataSourceComponent classes.  In addition, now we
          have some specific configuration information for our Guardian
          Component.  In order to read that information into your system,
          Avalon Framework provides some conveniences for you:

          This does simplify all the code we had for hand-building the

          last look at our Container class and see if we really have some
          savings.  Keep in mind that we have five components specified (a

          each of them.

          There is a lot of activity happening under the hood of the
          ExcaliburComponentManager.  For each "component" element in the
          configuration file, Excalibur creates a ComponentHandler for each
          class entry and maps it to the role entry.  The "component" element
          and all it's child elements are used for the Configuration of the
          Component.  When the Component is an ExcaliburComponentSelector, the
          Excalibur reads each "component-instance" element and performs the
          same type of operation as before-this time mapping to the hint entry.

          <title>Making the Configuration Pretty</title>
          <para>
            We can manage the configuration file's appearance with the use of
            aliases.  Excalibur uses a RoleManager to provide aliases for the
            configuration system.  A RoleManager can either be a dedicated
            class that you create, or you can use the DefaultRoleManager and
            pass in a Configuration object.  If I use the DefaultRoleManager, I
            will hide the role configuration file inside the jar with the rest
            of the system.  This is because the role configuration file is only
            going to be altered by developers.  Below is the interface for the
            RoleManager:

          <para>
            Let's take a look at how Excalibur uses the RoleManager in our
            scheme.  First, Excalibur will cycle through all the elements that
            are direct children of the root element.  This includes all
            "component" elements like before, but this time when Excalibur
            doesn't recognize an element name, it asks the RoleManager which
            role we should use for this Component.  If the RoleManager returns
            null, the element and all it's child elements are ignored.  Next,
            Excalibur derives the class name from the role name.  The last
            method is to dynamically map a class name to a ComponentSelector's
            child type.
          </para>
          <para>
            Excalibur provides a default implementation of the RoleManager that
            is configured with an XML configuration file.  The markup is very
            simple, and it hides all the extra information you don't want your
            administrator to see.

      Now that we have created our Components, we will want to use them.  You
      access Components the same way regardless of how they were instantiated
      or managed.  You must implement the Composable interface to get a
      reference to the ComponentManager.   The ComponentManager holds all the
      references to the Components you need.  For the sake of our discussion,
      we will assume that the ComponentManager given to us is configured in the
      same manner as the final Configuration file in the last section.  This
      means that we have a Repository, a Guardian, and two DataSources.

      <title>Rules for Using the Component Management Infrastructure</title>
      <para>
        The Component management infrastructure requires that you release any
        Component for which you have obtained a reference.  The reason for this
        restriction is so that the Component's resources can be properly
        managed.  A ComponentManager is designed for cases when you have
        multiple types of Components with distinct roles.  A ComponentSelector
        is designed for cases when you have multiple types of Components
        with the same role.  Another unique aspect of the ComponentSelector is
        that it is a Component by design.  This enables us to get a
        ComponentSelector from a ComponentManager.
      </para>
      <para>
        There are two valid approaches for handling references to external
        Components.  You can obtain your references during initialization, and
        release them during disposal.  You may also encapsulate the Component
        handling in a try/catch/finally block.  Each has its advantages and
        disadvantages.

          As you can see by the sample code, this is easy to follow.  The
          object gets a reference to a Guardian Component when it first
          receives the ComponentManager.  If you could be guaranteed that the
          Guardian Component was ThreadSafe, then this is all that is
          necessary.  Unfortunately, you cannot guarantee this for the long
          term.  To properly manage resources, we must release the Component
          when we are done with it.  That's why we kept a reference to the
          ComponentManager.
        </para>
        <para>
          The main disadvantage of this approach comes into play when you are
          dealing with pooled Components.  The reference of the Component is
          kept for the life of this object.  It might not be a problem if the
          object had a short life span, but if it was a Component managed by
          the Excalibur component management architecture, its life span is as
          long as the Component whose reference it has.  What this means is
          that we are essentially turning the Component's pool into a Factory.
        </para>
        <para>
          The main advantage of this approach is that the code is very clear on
          how a Component is obtained and released.  You don't have to have any
          understanding of exception handling.
        </para>
        <para>
          One other nuance is that you are tying the existence of the Guardian
          to the ability to initialize this object.  Once an Exception is
          thrown during the initialization phase of an object, you must assume
          that the object is not valid.  Sometimes you want to fail if a
          required Component does not exist so this is not a problem.  You do
          need to be aware of this implication when you are designing your
          Components though.

        <para>
          As you can see, the code is a bit more complex.  In order to
          understand it, you have to understand Exception handling.  This is
          not necessarily a problem, because most Java developers know how to
          handle them.  You don't have to worry so much about the Component
          life style with this approach, because we are releasing it as soon
          as we no longer need it.
        </para>
        <para>
          The main disadvantage of this approach is the added complexity of the
          exception handling code.  In order to minimize the complexity and
          make the code more maintainable, we extracted the working code into
          another method.  Keep in mind that we can get the reference to as
          many Components as we possibly want inside the try block.
        </para>
        <para>
          The main advantage of this approach is that you are managing your
          Component references more efficiently.  Again, there is no real
          difference if you are using ThreadSafe Components, but it makes a
          real difference when you have pooled Components.  There is a slight
          overhead dealing with getting a new reference every time you use a
          Component, but the likelihood of being forced to create a new
          instance of the Component is minimized.
        </para>
        <para>
          Just like the Initialization and Disposal Approach, you have to
          understand a subtle nuance.  The Exception Handling Approach does not
          fail on initialization if the Component is missing from the manager.
          As mentioned before, this is not entirely bad.  Many times, you want
          an object to exist, but it is not a failure if a desired Component
          is missing.

      <title>Getting Components from a ComponentSelector</title>
      <para>
        For most operations, you will only need the ComponentManager.  Since we
        decided that we needed multiple instances of the DataSourceComponent,
        we need to know how to get the instance we want.  ComponentSelectors
        are a little trickier than ComponentManagers because we are dealing
        with hints to get the reference we need.  A Component has a specific
        Role, and this contract is well documented.  However, sometimes we need
        to select one of many Components for a Role.  A ComponentSelector uses
        an arbitrary object for the hint.  Most of the time, the object is a
        String, although you might want to use a Locale object to get a proper
        internationalization Component.
      </para>
      <para>
        In our system we have set up, we chose to use Strings to select the
        correct instance of the DataSourceComponent.  We even gave ourselves a
        Configuration element that references the exact string we need to get
        the right Component.  This is a good practice to follow, as it makes it
        easier on administrators of a system.  It is easier for an
        administrator to see a reference to another Component than it is for
        them to remember magic values for the configuration.
      </para>
      <para>
        Conceptually, getting a Component from a ComponentSelector is no
        different than getting a Component from a ComponentManager.  You just
        have one more step.  Remember that a ComponentSelector is a Component.
        The ComponentManager will be set up to return the ComponentSelector
        when you lookup its role.  You then need to select the component from
        the selector.  To demonstrate, I will extend the code from the
        Exception Handling Approach discussed previously.

        suffix to the Role name.  It is also perfectly acceptable to use a
        static interface for all the Role names in your system to minimize the
        number of String concatenation in your code.

      <para>
        The CLI utilities are used by a number of projects including Avalon
        Phoenix and Apache Cocoon to process command line arguments.  It
        provides facilities to print help responses, and to process options by
        either a short name or a long name.

      <title>Collection Utilities</title>
      <para>
        The collection utilities provide some enhancements to the 
        <trademark>Java</trademark> Collections API.  Among them is the ability
        to find the intersections between two lists and a
        <classname>PriorityQueue</classname> that is an enhancement to
        <classname>Stack</classname> to allow the priority of objects override
        the simple first in/last out <classname>Stack</classname>
        implementation.

      <title>Component Management</title>
      <para>
        We already discussed the use of this in the previous section.  This is
        Excalibur's most complex beast, but it provides a lot of functionality
        in just a few classes.  It will make one distinction more than simple
        <classname>SingleThreaded</classname> or
        <classname>ThreadSafe</classname> for managing a component type:
        <classname>Poolable</classname>.  If a Component implements Excalibur's
        <classname>Poolable</classname> interface instead of the
        <classname>SingleThreaded</classname> interface, it will maintain a
        pool of Components and reuse instances.  Most of the time this works
        great.  For those last remaining times where a Component cannot be
        reused, use the <classname>SingleThreaded</classname> interface.

      <title>LogKit Management</title>
      <para>
        The Avalon development team realized that many people wanted a simple
        mechanism to build complex Logging target heirarchies.  In the same
        spirit as the <classname>RoleManager</classname> the team developed
        a <classname>LogKitManager</classname> that can be given to the
        Excalibur Component Management system meantioned above.  Based on the
        "logger" attribute it will give the proper <classname>Logger</classname>
        object to the different Components.

      <title>Thread Utilities</title>
      <para>
        The <emphasis>concurrent</emphasis> package contains several classes
        to assist in multithreaded programming: <classname>Lock</classname>
        (a mutex implementation), <classname>DjikstraSemaphore</classname>,
        <classname>ConditionalEvent</classname>, and
        <classname>ThreadBarrier</classname>.
      </para>

      <title>Datasources</title>
      <para>
        This is modeled after the <classname>javax.sql.DataSource</classname>
        class, but simplified.  There are two implementations of the
        <classname>DataSourceComponent</classname>: one that pools JDBC
        connections explicitly, and one that uses a J2EE application server's
        <classname>javax.sql.DataSource</classname> class.
      </para>

      <title>Input/Output (IO) Utilities</title>
      <para>
        The IO utilties provide a number of <classname>FileFilter</classname>s
        and other <classname>File</classname> and IO specific utilities.
      </para>

      <title>Pool Implementations</title>
      <para>
        The Pool implementations provide a <classname>Pool</classname> for
        every occasion.  You have an implementation that is blazingly fast, but
        only usable in one thread&mdash;which should be ok for implementing a
        FlyWeight pattern.  You also have <classname>DefaultPool</classname>,
        which does not manage the number of objects in its pool.
        <classname>SoftResourceManagingPool</classname> decommissions objects
        that exceed a threshold when they are returned.  Lastly,
        <classname>HardResourceManagingPool</classname> throws an exception
        when you have reached the maximum number of objects.  The last three
        pools are all <classname>ThreadSafe</classname>.
      </para>

      <title>Property Utilities</title>
      <para>
        The property utilities are used in conjunction with Context objects.
        They give you the ability to expand "variables" in your
        <classname>Resolvable</classname> object.  It works like this:
        <parameter>"${resource}"</parameter> will look for a Context value
        named <parameter>"resource"</parameter> and substitute its value
        for the symbol.
