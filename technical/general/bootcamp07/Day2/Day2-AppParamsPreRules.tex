        \section{Application Parameters}
            There are two types of Application Parameters:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Lists of values 
                \item KualiParameterRule - whether or not a given set of values is valid
            \end{itemize}
    \end{s5slide}
    \begin{s5slide}
        \section{Some Application Parameters for ObjectCode}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item isLegalObjectCode - looks up illegal values from database
            \end{itemize}
            \begin{s5notes}
                Walk through db to show what values we have
            \end{s5notes}
    \end{s5slide}
    \begin{s5slide}
        \section{KualiParameterRule}
            
        \begin{s5notes}
            Show KualiAccountingDocumentActionBase
        \end{s5notes}
    \end{s5slide}
    \begin{s5slide}
        \section{When to use which?}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Use ApplicationParameter when it is not business-related but more configuration (this is a new idea and hasn't fully populated yet)
                \item Use KualiParameterRule when it is a business requirement that can be configured
            \end{itemize}
    \end{s5slide}
    \begin{s5slide}
        \section{Pre rules}
            Pre rules are needed for the following cases:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item You need to ask the user a question (ie - did you mean to use a closed account?)
                \item You need to modify data on the form behind the scenes
            \end{itemize}
            Currently in KFS you cannot modify data on BOs (or documents) in rules as the entire document is deep-copied before passing in
    \end{s5slide}
    \begin{s5slide}
        \section{ObjectCode PreRules}
            Now we need to add in some PreRules for ObjectCode
            \begin{itemize}
                \item setting the right reports to chart of account
                \item inactive Object Level Code - Are you sure you want to use an inactive Object Level Code
            \end{itemize}
