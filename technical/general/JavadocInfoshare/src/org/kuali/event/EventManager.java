 * Simple, starter implementation of an event subsystem. Right now, only 
 * <code>{@link PolicyEvent}</code> objects need to be handled because the only 
 * system being handled right now is for <code>{@link Policy}</code> objects.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * A <code>{@link PolicyEvent}</code> may be handled any way restricted by the 
 * imagination just as a <code>{@link Policy}</code> is implemented. Evaluation of 
 * a <code>{@link Policy}</code> may generate a <code>{@link PolicyEvent}</code>. 
 * Since a <code>{@link Policy}</code> is arbitrarily implemented, it is possible 
 * that the <code>{@link PolicyEvent}</code> may also be arbitrary. There may be 
 * none at all.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * It is possible to log events in a database or even into a serialized persistent 
 * backing store or just a log file.
