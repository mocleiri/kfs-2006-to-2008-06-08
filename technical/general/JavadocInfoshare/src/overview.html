<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
To manage business objects appropriately, a set of business rules are applied. 
A business rule is an acceptable use case scenario
that describes the intended behavior of a business object. One goal
of the Kuali API is to offer, extension of it through the creation of
business objects; likewise, business rules may be required to handle
additional business objects.<br/>
<br/>
The role of a business object deterimines the rule(s) that are to be
applied. The TransactionalDocument is the most interesting business
object in the scope of this document.<br/>
<br/>
A set of business rules are defined for a TransactionalDocument.
Base rules packaged with the Kuali Project API may fulfill the needs
of some institutions; however, it is not expected that the base rules
are adequate for every institution or for all requirements of the application.
Some institutions may have a proprietary set of rules to
be applied to existing TransactionalDocument business objects to
support new or existing business rules.<br/>
<br/>
It has been decided that a framework to support creation of or
modification of arbitrary business rules without require special maintenance
of Kuali project source code is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
When an institution desires to create third-party business rules for any reason,
the available framework is expected to support the creation regardless of
the complexity. This flexibility comes from isolating the business rules from
the Kuali API save two interfaces (PolicyFactory and Policy.)<br/>
<br/>
The aforementioned flexibility allows arbitrary business rule definitions
to be implemented without the need for proprietary code modifications. To
summarize, the beneficial characteristics of the framework are:
<ul>
  <li/>Allow arbitrary class definitions implementing the Policy interface.
  <li/>Delegate constructor and method calls, so the framework will automatically
instantiate Policy implementations.
  <li/>Allow Policy implementations proper access to TransactionalDocument
instances.
  <li/>Policy implementations can be maintained independently of Kuali API.
</ul>
