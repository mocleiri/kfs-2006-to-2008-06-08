    There are some instances in \KualiFinancialSystem\ where \Inheritance\ is possibly misused where \Encapsulation\ may have not
    only been a better fit, but may have also lessened or even eliminated the need for refactoring. This document explains how 
    \Encapsulation\ can mitigate the need for future refactorings. \Inheritance\ as it is now in Java limits modularity and orthogonal design.

    \item[\Inheritance] is if and only if the \texttt{extends} directive is used with the \texttt{class} or \texttt{interface} clause. 
      It is important to understand that Java does not support \MultiInheritance. Java can achieve \Polymorphism by a \texttt{class} 
      implementing an \texttt{interface}.

      \begin{quote}
        Semantically, \Inheritance\ denotes an ``is-a'' relationship. \ldots 
        \Inheritance\ thus implies a genralization/specialization hierarchy, 
        wherein a subclass specializes the more general structure or behavior of its superclasses. --Grady Booch ~\cite{gbtwo}
      \end{quote}
      Based on the above quote from Grady Booch, we can assume that \Inheritance\ forms a kind of hierarchy which is an element in the 
      \ObjectModel.

      Java does not support \MultiInheritance. The only hierarchy choice is for single-inheritance through the \texttt{extends} clause as
      described above. Simply put:
      \begin{description}
      \item[Single-\Inheritance] is when one class inherits from a single superclass. The visual representation of such a hierarchy always looks
        like a tree.

      \W \begin{s5slide}
        \W \section{Encapsulation is\ldots}
        \item[\Encapsulation] is a technique of enclosing class functionality through object instances within another class. Many 
          design patterns employ \Encapsulation. Among these patterns are Delegate/Aggregate, Composite, Decorator, and Adapter (some may know these
          patterns by other names.) \Encapsulation\ can be by implementation (as in implementing and abstraction,) or aggregation.  Grady Booch 
          calls aggregation a ``part of'' relationship. See the following example:
          \W \end{s5slide}

      I cite the ``Gang of Four'' in this paper, and they refer to \Encapsulation\ as ``Object Composition.''
      
      \W \begin{s5slide}
        \W \section{An Encapsulation Example}
        \T \subsubsection{An \Encapsulation\ Example}
        \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_Injection}{Dependency Injection} is a very widely-used example of \Encapsulation\
          throughout \KFS. Basically, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_Injection}{Dependency Injection} achieves \emph{Loose Coupling}
          or \Modularity\ by  encapsulating functionality from other classes through delegating the implementations.
      \W \end{s5slide}
  \end{description}

  \begin{tex}
  In simple terms, inheritance and encapsulation are both intended for implementation. Inheritance can be called an ``is a'' relationship, and
  encapsulation can be called a ``part of'' relationship type. Inheritance and encapsulation are both complementary to abstraction.

  The ``Gang of Four'' compares them as source reuse paradigms where \Inheritance\ represents ``white-box'' reuse and \Encapsulation\ represents
  ``black-box'' reuse.
  \end{tex}

  \W \begin{s5slide}
    \W \section{What is the Problem?}
    \T \subsection{What is the Problem?}
    The problem is that Java supports \Polymorphism, but not \MultiInheritance. 
    Single-\Inheritance\ creates a single hierarchy that resembles a tree where there 
    is only one class at the very top (eg., for \sf{Java}\rm{}, the \texttt{Object} class is the top-most class in the hierarchy.)
    Resulting from the lack of \MultiInheritance, Java developers have designed object-oriented 
    patterns to sidestep single-\Polymorphism\ using \Encapsulation\ rather than \Inheritance.
    \W \end{s5slide}

  \begin{tex}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Java only has single-\Inheritance
    \item In order to achieve \Polymorphism\ and somewhat \MultiInheritance, Java uses \texttt{interfaces}.
    \item Interfaces are abstractions
    \item Java has a confusing \texttt{abstract} class
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{What to Look Out For}
    These are concerns that will be addressed later in the document.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item When to use \Inheritance?
    \item When to use \Encapsulation?
    \item What are examples of \Encapsulation\ in Kuali
    \item What are patterns of bad uses of \Inheritance?
    \item When is the \texttt{abstract} class necessary?
    \item Parallel hierarchies
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{What are Bad Smells?}
    A ``bad smell'' is a term from Martin Fowler's, \\ \underline{Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code.} They are pretty much hints
    given from the software system during development of areas that need or will need refactoring in the future.

    Below are some bad smells and examples of where some exist in \KFS.
    \begin{description}
      \item[Shotgun Surgery] occurs when a small change to a software system requires many requisite and dependency changes to be properly 
        implemented (eg., the DataDictionary.)
      \item[Parallel Hierarchies] are\ldots well, just see the section on Parallel Hierarchies.

  \texonly{This has already been discussed in gross detail. Now we are going to show more examples
  of the differences and explain them. In this section, we will go through different scenarios
  to explore the differences. Here are some basic bullet points.}
    \W \begin{s5slide}
      \W \section{How Do They Differ?}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item They are different kinds of relationships
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \Inheritance\ is an "is a" relationship type
          \item \Encapsulation\ is a "part of" relationship type
          \end{itemize}
        \item \Modularity\ and Coupling
          \begin{itemize}
          \item \Inheritance\ leads to tight coupling
          \item \Encapsulation\ leads to loose coupling
          \end{itemize}
        \item In the \ObjectModel
          \begin{itemize}
          \item \Inheritance\ builds hierarchy
          \item \Encapsulation\ is the implementation of an \Abstraction\ which are
            combined for \Modularity
          \end{itemize}
        \item \Polymorphism
      \end{itemize}
    \W \end{s5slide}

    \begin{tex}
      \subsection{Isn't \Inheritance\ a Good Thing?}
      Not always. As it has been mentioned before, \Inheritance\ is used to build up the Hierarchy.
      Basically, that means it adds structure to whatever your Model is. Since it is an ``is a'' relationship,
      the structure is intended to be pretty concrete.
      
      The ``Gang of Four'' calls this kind of paradigm ``white-box'' reuse where 
      ``the internals of parent classes are often visible to subclasses.''

      They have also made it a point that \Inheritance\ can be pretty dangerous if abused.
      \begin{quote}
        Nevertheless, our experience is that designers overuse \Inheritance\ as a reuse technique and designs 
        are often made more reusable (and simpler) by depending more on object composition. You'll see object 
        composition applied again and again in design-patterns.
      \end{quote}

      \subsection{Why is \Encapsulation\ Better than \Inheritance?}
      \Encapsulation\ is the implementation to your \Abstraction. Some may be thinking now, 
      ``Isn't \Inheritance\ also implementation?'' It is, but not for an \Abstraction. Since \Inheritance\ 
      is building concrete structure to your Model, it is constricting with \Abstraction. If you 
      consider that Implementation and \Abstraction\ are what make your application Modular, then
      \Inheritance\ is actually taking away the \Modularity.
      
      Simply put, ``If you want your application to be more Modular, use \Encapsulation\ and \Abstraction\ 
      more liberally.'' If you want to rely on a more strict Model (say for strict typing) use \Inheritance.

      The ``Gang of Four'' has a different idea on this. They believe that \Inheritance\ and \Encapsulation\
      work together.
      \begin{quote}
        \ldots the set of available components is never quite rich enough in practice. Reuse by inheritance 
        makes it easier to make new components that can be composed with old ones. Inheritance and object
        composition thus work together.
      \end{quote}

      This may be the case, but they also suggest that \Inheritance\ is still pretty dangerous.
      
      The ``Gang of Four'' suggested a common principle to abide by in order to overcome these troubles.      
      \begin{quote}
        Favor object composition over class \Inheritance.
      \end{quote}      
      
      In most cases, you will want to use \Encapsulation\ and \Abstraction\ because in most cases
      you are trying to develop Orthogonal and Modular code.

        In Labor we were faced with the problem of reusing the General Ledger without refactoring it ... a lot, and 
        without introducing weird design quirks into Labor Distribution. In simple terms, ``Reuse GL, but don't 
        mess it up, don't reuse anything unnecessary, and don't be lame.''

        This is where our \Encapsulation\ is \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_Injection}{Dependency Injection}.
        With \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_Injection}{Dependency Injection}, we were able to reuse 
        all the interfaces within Labor and by \Encapsulation\ of functionality from the General Ledger, we were able to 
        pick and choose what was important for us to reuse and what we didn't care about. True \Modularity.

    \W \section{Struts/Spring Scenario}
    \T \subsubsection{Struts/Spring Scenario (aka. Encapsulating Actions or Does Spring + Struts = String?)}
    What can end up happening as a result of using Interfaces (not always a result of \Encapsulation,) is parallel hierarchies. Parallel
    hierarchies are generally a good thing. They make the code self-documenting. When parallel hierarchies get to be 4 or even 5 wide, then
    it's just a bit too much.

    Sometimes these can result from \Encapsulation, but the inverse is also true. \Encapsulation\ can be used to solve parallel hierarchies. Take
    \emph{Struts} for example. A mapping of a \sf StrutsForm \rm and a \sf StrutsAction \rm are always required. Because \emph{Struts} uses
    \Inheritance\ to create this structure, it is difficult to reduce it. Here is an example of how \emph{Spring} services can be used with
    \Encapsulation\ to reduce a parallel hierarchy.\

          is inherited implementation with deferred construction. You can achieve the same

    \begin{tex}
      Fowler refers to Parallel Hierarchies as a ``special case of shotgun surgery'' because one minor change requires modification of 
      one ore more classes. 
      \begin{quote}
        In this case, every time you make a subclass of one class, you also have to make a subclass of another\ldots the prefixes of 
        the class names in one hierarchy are the same as the prefixes in another hierarchy.
      \end{quote}
      
      Some software engineers see this isn't actually a bad thing, but rather a blessing. It forces tight coupling and strict typing
      in a sense. I think Fowler explained it best.
      \end{tex}
      \begin{quote}
        Often you start inheriting from a class but then find that many of the superclass operations aren't really true of the subclass
        \ldots you have an interface that is not a true reflection of what the class does.
      \end{quote}
      \begin{tex}
      The above is actually true of \Inheritance\ in general, but one is certain to encounter such a scenario when a 
      Parallel Hierarchy is created.
    \end{tex}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Causes confusion in class hierarchies
        \item Forces inconsistency in classes. Some classes don't do what they should and do other things they shouldn't.
        \item Forces developers to change numerous classes for a minor alteration in the software system.
      \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Examples of Parallel Hierarchies}

        \W \section{Examples of Parallel Hierarchies}
        The above should sound pretty familiar. This is one of the fundamental flaws in Struts. Whenever one creates a mapping, an
      \sf{ActionForm}\rm{} and a \sf{Action}\rm{} both need to be created. In an earlier section I describe how to merge the
        hierarchies using Fowler's ``Replace \Inheritance\ with Delegation'' refactoring and 
        \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_Injection}{Dependency Injection}.

      \subsection{Examples that Exist in \KFS}
      I've already mentioned Struts Parallel Hierarchies which exist in \KFS, but there are others. 

      \begin{description}
        \W \begin{s5slide}
        \W \section{Examples that Exist in KFS}
        \item[\sf{SourceAccountingLine}\rm{} and \sf{TargetAccountingLine}\rm{}]
          This has recently been refactored, but the problem still remains because 
          \sf{SourceAccountingLine}\rm{} and \sf{TargetAccountingLine}\rm{} instances are required in tandem for most financial documents. 
          If ever a specialized version is required, one needs create both a \sf{SourceAccountingLine}\rm{} and a \sf{TargetAccountingLine}\rm{}
          class.
          \W \end{s5slide}
        
        \W \begin{s5slide}
          \W \section{Examples that Exist in KFS}
      \item[\sf{AccountingDocument}\rm{} and \sf{AccountingDocumentRule}\rm{}]
          This actually includes the Struts parallel hierarchy. The problem is the same though. Whenver a \sf{AccountingDocument}\rm{} subclass 
          is created, then a \sf{AccountingDocumentRule}\rm{} is also required.
